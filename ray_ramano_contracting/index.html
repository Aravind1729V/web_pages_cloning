        <h3>JAMIE FLOYD: UPPER WEST SIDE CLASSIC 6</h3><br>
        <p>
          "Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an
          eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. I do not recommend it for
          anyone. It is CRAZY. But <br />
          we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray Romano and his team got
          it done! The place is beautiful!"
        </p><br>
        <h3>DONNA AND SCOTT: RESCUED RENOVATION</h3><br>
        <p>
          "Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are
          great, neat and real artisans. We recommend him very highly and I bet
          before we know <br />
          it, there will be another "Everybody loves Raymond," but on HGTV or
          TLC!"
        </p><br>
        <h3>DAVID SIEGEL: DOUBLED THE VALUE</h3><br>
        <p>
          "Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a
          pleasure. He more than doubled the value of my apartment through his
          gut <br> renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to make
          home improvements."
